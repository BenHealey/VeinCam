VeinCam is an educational tool for vein visualisation. It uses near infrared (nIR) light and a low-cost camera to stream a real-time image with vein enhancement. Its an open-source, build-it-yourself device so anyone who finds it useful will be able to make it.

# 1. Project Goals
There are 3 goals we wish to achieve this semester:

1. Develop a set of hardware requirements that are suitable for the VeinCam Project.
2. Optimise the software to run more efficiently.
3. Compile procurement options to develop kits to be able to be sold onto those who wish to build a VeinCam for themselves.

# 2. Decision Log
Major decisions that affect the majority or all of the project's future work and/or operations can be found in the [Decision Log](Administration/Project/Decision-Log.md/).
