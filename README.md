VeinCam is an educational tool for vein visualisation. It uses near infrared (nIR) light and a camera to stream a real-time image where veins can be easily seen. It is an open-source, build-it-yourself device so anyone who finds it useful will be able to construct it. There is a how-to guide of what materials to buy, how to put them together and the software to upload to get it all working.

This is the repository for the continuation of the VeinCam Project as an ANU Engineering Captone Project in 2019. The repository for the previous work can be found [HERE](https://www.github.com/chrisbodger/veincam). This repository will be used to delineate and document the progress made this semester, in what is to be the next chapter of this exciting project.

# 1. Project Goals
There are 3 goals we wish to achieve this semester:

1. Develop a set of hardware requirements that are suitable for the VeinCam Project.
2. Optimise the software to run more efficiently.
3. Compile procurement options to develop kits to be able to be sold onto those who wish to build a VeinCam for themselves.

# 2. Feedback
A feedback form has been created for the interest of our stakeholders, should they wish to pass on any changes or improvements they believe to be prudent. The form can be found [here](https://goo.gl/forms/8cw5eWdaOY5C1jBo1).

# 3. Project Updates
### Week 11 - 22/05/2019

### Poster Showcase
The team presented VeinCam to a large science and engineering audience at the Project Showcase on the 20/5/19. A summary of the presentation and feedback is available [here](Administration/Communications/Poster-Presentation-Summary.md).

### School Visit
The team showcased VeinCam to Gungahlin College and gained insightful feedback into how VeinCam could be used in a secondary school environment. A summary of the visit is available [here](Administration/Communications/Gungahlin-College-Visit-210519.md).

#### Hardware
Final prototypes of the VeinCam enclosure completed, along with some PCB changes to better utilise onboard LEDs. Pricing for enclosure, along with final bill of materials determined. 

### Software

This week was spent getting all documenation up to date. Colour functionality added to MJPEG steam, fixed banding effects and scaling to better suit mobile and tablet users. 

### Previous Updates
More specific updates regarding each sub-team are available in the sub-team work diaries. These can be found in the [Hardware](/Hardware/HardwareDiary.md) and [Software](/Software/SoftwareDiary.md) folders, as well as team [Decision Logs](/Administration/Project/Decision-Log.md) are other locations for progress notes, should they not be located on this page.

# 4. Concept of Operations
Our Concept of Operations has been signed off by all parties involved. 

The [Concept of Operations](Administration/Project/CONOPS.md) document can be found in our repository.

# 5. Meeting Minutes
The team regularly meet to formally discuss the project's progress, as well as through other communication channels. the minutes from the formal discussions can be found in the [Meeting Minutes](Administration/meeting-minutes/) directory.

# 6. Decision Log
Major decisions that affect the majority or all of the project's future work and/or operations can be found in the [Decision Log](Administration/Project/Decision-Log.md/).
