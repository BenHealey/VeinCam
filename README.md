#VeinCam

VeinCam is an educational tool for vein visualisation. It uses near infrared (nIR) light and a nIR-sensitive camera to stream a real-time vein-enhanced video image to a user's phone or tablet. In addition to a custom PCB to control the nIR light source, the device employs widely available low-cost components from the [Raspberry Pi educational foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

VeinCam is *not* a certified medical device and is therefore not intended for use in a clinical setting.

### 1. Development History
Much of VeinCam's development occurred during [ANU Engineering](https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/) capstone projects in 2018 and 2019. Created as an open-source project, anyone who may find VeinCam useful for learning can get the information necessary to make one for their own personal use in this GitHub repository.

### 2. Structure of the Repository
The repository is broadly split into Hardware and Software sections.

Each section contains schematics or code for the components of the device. The root folders for each section contain *readme* files outlining their contents and key aspects of functionality. The *assembly* instructions in each folder outline at a high level how to get the device working.

Please note that the hardware and software licences prohibit use of this information by anyone other than the developers to create commercial versions of VeinCam for sale to others.

### 3. Hardware Kit
Many people will not have access to the equipment required to make the hardware components of the device, so we are in the process of finalising a low-cost kit you can purchase. (due end of 2019)

You can check availability at the [VeinCam Hardware Kit website](https://veincam.com/).
