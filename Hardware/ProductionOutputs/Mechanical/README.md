## NOTE
We are relying on the draft angle from the laser cutter to hold the lens in. Different lasers/lenses/focal lengths will alter this draft angle and this needs to be taken into account.  

We also needed to flip the top acrylic to ensure that the lens would not fall out, as by default the lens was pushed in from the front. 

The dimensions may also need to be altered depending on how wide the laser cuts.

Any questions ask Josh, easier to explain with a VeinCam in hand and in person.
